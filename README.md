# Automated-Testing-using-Selenium

This Repository contains a sorting algorithm visualizer and two python files (defect.py and validation.py).

1) Sorting algorithm visualizer takes txt file and sorts it.
2) Format of txt file should be as following: "1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 5".
3) There are 2 different files for 2 different automated tests (defect testing and validation testing): <br>
   1) In defect testing, it prompts an error if the input file type consists of the wrong data to be sorted.<br>
   2) In validation testing, it ensures if the data entered through file has been sorted successfully or not.<br>
4) For testing correct and incorrect data type use input.txt and inputw.txt respectively.
6) MAKE SURE TO LEAVE A STAR ⭐️.
